Project description:
Philisophy:
1. If you want to make the God laugh - share your plans with him.
   If you want to make laugh thw whole world - share your plans via Internet
2. So, if you want to keep your tasks in secret, you need completely portable application. The only thing you need from web is to read (but not send)  emails.
3. 
Goal: create portable single-user task manager. Learn appropriate technologies and frameworks. Play with loose coupled persistance layer. Play with styling, localization, custom controls
Stack: WPF, Prism, SQLite 
Arcitecture pattern: some fantasy about clean architecture. I want to create almost independent persistavnce layer. View layer - MVVM (Prism as a base)

Notes:
1. SQLite is chosen to provide portability
2. Prism - basic framework to learn,
3. DI - built-in Prism for View-Service layer, for Dervice-Persistance Not Set.
