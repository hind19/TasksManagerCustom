Project description:
Goal: create portable single-user task manager. Learn appropriate technologies and frameworks. Play with loose coupled persistance layer. Play with styling, localization
Stack: WPF, Prism, SQLite 
Arcitecture pattern: some fantasy about clean architecture. I want to create almost independent persistavnce layer. View layer - MVVM (Prism as a base)

Notes:
1. SQLite is chosen to provide portability
2. Prism - basic framework to learn,
3. Automapper - haven't decided yet.
4. DI - built-in Prism for View-Service layer, for Dervice-Persistance - haven't decided yet.
